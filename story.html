                                    Before joining SheCanCode, I never thought it was possible

                                <p>I joined SheCanCODE program a few months after
                                    finishing another coding program that I was taking.
                                    In the previous program, I was not really satisfied
                                    with what I just learned and SheCode program came
                                    in as a solution to feeding my desires<details> get back
                                        on track. I am a student at SNHU which is about business
                                        but I am also very passionate about computer programming.
                                        Therefore, getting a chance to join SheCanCode was
                                        relieving and exciting as it was a chance to keep
                                        building my career. Now that I've finished the program,
                                        I couldn't be any happier. After the program, I joined
                                        the fellowship in DMM. Hehe, a company that develops
                                        mobile technologies for brands to elevate their service
                                        delivery and started working as a software developer.
                                        I am also involved in storefronts testing and it is a
                                        great experience that I am having. Thanks to SheCanCode
                                        for paving a way to my dream career.
